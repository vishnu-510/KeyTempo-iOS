# KeyTempo – iOS Audio Analyzer

KeyTempo is an iOS app that detects the BPM and musical key of audio files using
digital signal processing techniques.

## Features
- Import audio files (MP3 / WAV)
- BPM detection using energy-based peak analysis
- Musical key detection using FFT & pitch class profiles
- Confidence score for BPM accuracy
- Glassmorphic SwiftUI interface

## Tech Stack
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- AVFoundation
- Audio DSP (energy, FFT concepts)

## What I Learned
- Audio buffer processing using AVAudioPCMBuffer
- BPM normalization and tempo ambiguity handling
- FFT-based frequency analysis
- Clean SwiftUI architecture for audio apps
